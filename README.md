# Quantified Self [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joequincy/quantified-self-be.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/joequincy/quantified-self-be)
Authored by: [Deonte Cooper](https://github.com/djc00p) and [Jon Peterson](https://github.com/joequincy)

A calorie tracker using JavaScript, built on NodeJS with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is used for an ORM.

This project is a Mod 4 paired assignment from the Turing School of Software and Design. [Assignment details are available](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/66a39813572f453700ab944948ecf698b0b75d42/module4/projects/quantified_self/qs_server_side.md) in the [@turingschool](https://github.com/turingschool) curriculum repository.

### Setup
From the project root, run:
- `npm install`
- `npx sequelize db:create`
- `npx sequelize db:migrate`
- `npx sequelize db:seed`

To start the API server, run `npm start`, then access endpoints as described below. Default port on `localhost` is `3000`.

### Learning Goals
- Coming from a background learning Rails development, build a NodeJS application utilizing the same principles.
- Create an API using the Express framework, given specified endpoints and response formats (see: [Issues](https://github.com/joequincy/quantified-self-be/issues)).
- As a separate app, create a single-page webapp for the front-end which will interact with the server via the API without page changes or reloads (see: [quantified-self-fe](https://github.com/djc00p/quantified-self-fe)).

### Schema
Because this project utilizes a very simple data set, the database schema is likewise simple.
