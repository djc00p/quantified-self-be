**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):**
1. Ensure Issue card is present and in project board.
   - If a significant piece of support functionality is needed, create a new issue.
2. Assign Issue to self
   - Move card to In Progress column
   - Check out local Feature branch
3. Complete work
   - Push feature branch up to Github
4. Submit PR
   - Tag issue in PR body and quote user story
   - Add any additional details and documentation about how the problem was solved
   - Add GitHub comments about any code that might need explaining
   - Add teammate for review, optionally tag teammate, classmates, and/or instructors for additional feedback on any portion of changed code
     - If any feedback leads to code changes, add an :x: emoji to the PR title until the changes have been made and pushed.
   - Teammate merges code once PR is approved. All changes requested by teammate must be addressed prior to merge.
5. Merge to master
   - After merging, teammate who performed merge should pull down changes and deploy to Heroku

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**
Keep it specific, actionable, and kind. Prefer that feedback be given early, rather than letting it build.
